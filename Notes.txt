->Nodejs is open source server side javascript run time environment built on chrome v8 javascript engine
->it provides an event driven ,non-blocking i/o and cross platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server side applications using javascript
->it is written in c++
->apps like command line application,web application,REST API server
->How ever ,it is mainly used to build network programmes
  like web servers,similr to PHP,java,or ASP.network

How javascript works
---------------------
->chrome and nodejs are two environments which help to run the js code in browser and server side respectivelly
->when js code runs in the browser , it sends the code to the v8 engine which compiles and return the machine code 
->v8 engine is a google open source which helps to compile js code
->v8 is written c++
->chrome has implemented on window object along with original javascript code
->Node has implemented on the global object along with original javascript code
