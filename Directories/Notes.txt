Creating Parent Directories with multiple Files
-----------------------------------------------
-->In a Node.js application, you can use the mkdir() method provided by the fs core module to create a new directory.
-->This method works asynchronously to create a new directory at the given location.
-->You can pass an optional boolean parameter called recursive to the mkdir() 
-->When the recursive parameter is true, the mkdir() method doesn't throw any error even if the path already exists.
